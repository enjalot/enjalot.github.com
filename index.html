            When BART service was stopped due to two strikes in 2013 I organized a series of meetups

      <div class="description">
        I'm interested in working on new products and visualizations that help
        people implement and understand complex, data-related systems and workflows.
        The following diagram attempts to capture where I'm most valuable in the process of creating a new product or visualization:
        <img src="images/process.jpg" style="max-width:100%;">
        <p>
          I've found I am most effective early in the product-development process, especially in the <b>prototyping phase</b>.
          The diagram shows the progression of an idea to <b>Minimum Viable Product</b> as I see it.
          Often times the first question to follow an interesting idea is "Could this work?", and my favorite thing to do is
          figuring out if it could. After figuring out that it does indeed work, the hard but neccessary part for me is developing
          the functional prototype into some sort of minimum viable state that can be consumed by other stake-holders in the project.
          There is of course still a lot that needs to happen before a product can ship, but ideally I'm prototyping the next idea.
