            At Observable I put my 10 years of data visualization experience towards developing and demonstrating advanced data workflows.
            I've taught thousands of data practitioners via video, live workshops and interative learning materials.

          At Google I spent 4 years on the design team prototyping and developing data visualization tools to better understand the 100+ products in Google Cloud. 
          I collaborated with members of the Google Brain team to create interactive research publications.

            A the first hire at Lever I designed & developed the original data infrastructure, product features
            and internal tools. Many tools and data patterns that I designed were still in use when Lever was acquired for $500m.

      <div class="headline">Future work</div>
      <div class="description">
        I'm interested in working on new products and visualizations that help
        people implement and understand complex, data-related systems and workflows.
        The following diagram attempts to capture where I'm most valuable in the process of creating a new product or visualization:
        <img src="images/process.jpg" style="max-width:100%;">
        <p>
          I've found I am most effective early in the product-development process, especially in the <b><a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/user-experience-engineering-a98c7724d849">prototyping phase</a></b>.
          The diagram shows how I see the progression of an idea to Minimum Viable Product.
          Often times the first question to follow an interesting idea is "Could this work?", and my favorite thing to do is
          figuring out if it could. After figuring out that it does indeed work, the hard but neccessary part for me is developing
          the functional prototype into some sort of minimum viable state that can be consumed by other stake-holders in the project.
